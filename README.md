# Modelling Earth Systems - Project Code
A python reworking of the visco-elasto-plastic geodynamics code developed in the book *Numerical Geodynamic Modelling* by Taras Gerya [1]. It uses a finite difference staggered grid approach to solve the Stoke's, continuity and temperature equations, along with markers for advection.

## Installation
If you haven't already, made sure you have python 3 installed (you can do this by installing Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download, which will also include the packages required for this code).

The required python packages are listed in the `environment.yml` file.  To create a new conda environment with these packages installed, open a terminal (or on Windows the `anaconda_prompt` app from within the Anaconda naviagator), navigate to the directory in which you have downloaded this repository using `cd ./path/to/directory/on/your/computer/uu-mod-earth-systems` and then run the command `conda env create -f environment.yml` in the top directory of the repo.  This will create an environment called `modearth`, which can then be activated using `conda activate modearth` in the terminal (or by selecting it in the environments tab in Anaconda Navigator).  

## Running a model
The file `main.py` contains the central code, to run a model you can simply run this file from Spyder (or alternatively your choice of python interpreter). After activating your environment as described in the install instructions you can launch spyder by typing `spyder` in the terminal or by lauching it through the Anaconda Navigator. You can then open the `main.py` file in spyder and run it using the run icon in the top bar. 

Various model setups can be found in the `models` directory.  In each sub-directory you will find two files: `setup.py` and `material_properties.txt`.  These contain the code and required material parameters for that model, in a function called `initializeModel`, which is called by `main.py` to setup the simulation.

To run a given setup, change the import statement for the `initializeModel` function in `main.py` to point to the directory of the model you wish to run.  For example, to run the model in the directory `Subduction`, we change the import statement in `main.py` to `from models.Subduction.setup import initializeModel`.

## Creating your own model setup
To create your own model setup, you must create a new directory in `models` and populate it with an implementation of `setup.py` and `material_properties*.txt`. `setup.py` must contain the function `initializeModel` (see the docstring of the example implementations for details on what it should return), which sets the initial conditions, boundary conditions and parameter values for the simulation.  We recommend that you start by copying an existing `setup.py` and then modifying it for your own implementation.
